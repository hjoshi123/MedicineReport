# MedicineReport
An android app to report adverse drug effects based on the form given by [CDSCO](http://www.cdsco.nic.in/writereaddata/ADR%20form%20PvPI.pdf).

## Description

This android app was built during a **hacakthon** as a means to demonstrate how filing adverse drug reactions could be made easy. This app is not in production.
This app uses a custom encoding function to encode the entire form by CDSCO into 900 characters so that it can sent by sms to the company manufacturing drugs. This can then be handled by the comapny through a dashboard.

### Recognition
Runner Up of Mylan Hack for Cause Hacakthon 2018
